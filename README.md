# Fotogram

**Fotogram** is a simple, responsive photo album website. Images are dynamically rendered using JavaScript. When a user clicks on an image, it opens in a `<dialog>` element to display a larger view.

## Features

- Dynamic image loading via JavaScript
- Modal view using the native `<dialog>` element
- Enlarged image display on click
- Keyboard navigation with `Tab` and `Escape`
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Project Goal

This project is a learning exercise focused on:
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Using the `<dialog>` element for modals
- Handling events and improving accessibility
- Building clean and responsive UI with HTML/CSS

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Responsive Design)
- JavaScript (DOM, Events, `<dialog>`)

## Feedback Welcome!

Iâ€™d love to get feedback on:
- Code structure and readability (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Accessibility (e.g., keyboard support)
- Visual design and user experience
- Any ideas for improvements or new features
